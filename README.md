# Vectors-vs-List

This was an short assignment in CMPT 225 which asked to compare run times and efficiency between Lists and Vectors. I learned how to run test cases and time them to verify memory space usage when running a program. The "N" integer is the size of the vector/list and can be changed accordingly.
